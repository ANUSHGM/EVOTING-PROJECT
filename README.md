# EVOTING-PROJECT
This Project has been done using Angular as Frontend &amp; Java Springboot as Backend and Oracle database

- You can download the frontend code and run it using "npm start" command as it has been coded in Angular JS.
- You can download the backend code and run it using Eclipse (Spring Tool Suite)  or IntelliJ IDEA as it has been coded using Java - Springboot
- Once you run the backend code, the database setup automatically gets created.

Thank You.
